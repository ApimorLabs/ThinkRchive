/**
 * DOES NOT WORK DUE TO LONG STRING JSON OF Thinkpad OBJECT
 *
 * Helper functions to pass Parcelable objects into navigation argument:
 * As of compose-navigation-2.4.0-alpha06 there is no way to pass a Parcelable or
 * Serializable object in the navArgument since it will just implicitly cast it to a
 * String and will cause a crash when navigating with IllegalArgumentException.
 * This work around converts the object to a json string with YourType.toJsonString() which
 * can be passed as a string navArgument. Then you can rebuild this string on the other side
 * of navigation with String.fromJsonString() which will build your object.
 *
 * These can be called inside inside your composable or ViewModel.
 * To see their usage take a look at ThinkrchiveNavHost.kt and ThinkpadDetailsViewModel.kt
 *
 * This workaround is limited with the Json String length you can pass as an argument
 * inside where NavController won't be able to recognize your destination and end up
 * throwing an Exception.
 * For a workaround to this issue you can visit: https://stackoverflow.com/a/68009752/15285215
