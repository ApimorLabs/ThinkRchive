## 🧐 Fun Facts

- ThinkRchive
  originally used [a google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cFrYzzAP7i3bzSLKuBMykz3ZNUbf-YPTqRSEAwINy_E/edit?usp=sharing)
  as the backend via [Retrosheet](https://github.com/theapache64/retrosheet)
  
- ThinkRchive now uses [a custom Ktor powered server client](https://github.com/racka98/Thinkrchive-Server) as the backend. The backend is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

- I mocked the designs for this app on Figma and the finished app looks better than my initial designs

## ✅ TODO

- Add more Tests (Unit Tests, UI Tests, Integration Tests)
- Add more features
- Make a Compose for Desktop version
- Adapt project to KMM
